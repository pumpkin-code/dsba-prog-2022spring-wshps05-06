/// Programs ask a user to input their name, individually first and last part,
/// and outputs a name into two different form: 1) straight, 2) inverse with comma
///
/// In the end, try to input both first and last names in the same line. Why a
/// program considers two words separated with spaces as two independend inputs?
/// How to fix it? → see the “name_with_spaces” problem.
