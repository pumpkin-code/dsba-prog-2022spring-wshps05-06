/// \version    0.1.0
/// \date       22.01.2022
///             This code is for educational purposes of the course "Introduction
///             to programming" provided by the Faculty of Computer Science
///             at the Higher School of Economics.
///
/// TASK DESCRIPTION
///
/// A program reads from the standard input (cin) a sequence of strings, one by
/// one. Each string consists of a sequence of integers separated by spaces.
/// Neither the number of strings, nor the number of integers are known
/// in advance. The program sums numbers in a single line and prints the sum to
/// the standard output (cout), until the first empty line goes.
